2.0	Installation Notes

IF YOU HAVE NOT INSTALLED A mach64 WINDOWS DRIVER PREVIOUSLY, YOU 
MAYREQUIRE YOUR MICROSOFT WINDOWS DISKETTES TO COMPLETE THE 
INSTALLATION OF THIS DRIVER.  

1. Ensure that you have a copy LOAD64.ZIP.  It is available on the ATI 
BBS, ftp site (ftp.atitech.ca), and on our CompuServe forum (GO 
ATITECH).

2. Ensure that you have a copy of PKUNZIP.EXE, v1.10 or later.  PKUNZIP 
is available on most BBS and information services, including the ATI 
BBS and CompuServe.

3. Do NOT attempt to perform the driver installation from within 
Windows Exit Windows completely, and perform the following operations 
in DOS.

4. Unzip LOAD64.ZIP and 64WIN155.ZIP into the same temporary directory 
on your hard disk, then run the LOAD64.EXE utility.  For example:

MD \ATITEMP
PKUNZIP LOAD64.ZIP \ATITEMP
PKUNZIP 64WIN155.ZIP \ATITEMP
CD \ATITEMP
LOAD64.EXE

5. Follow the screen prompts for installing the Windows driver.  

IF YOU RECEIVE AN ERROR MESSAGE, INDICATING THAT A CERTAIN FONT (.fon) 
FILE IS NOT PRESENT, YOU WILL NEED TO RUN WINDOWS SETUP FROM DOS TO 
COMPLETE THE INSTALLATION.  WINDOWS SETUP WILL PROMPT YOU FOR THE DISKS 
ON WHICH THESE FONT FILES ARE FOUND.

6. Once the driver has been installed, you can delete the contents of 
the temporary directory (DEL \ATITEMP\*.*) and delete the directory 
itself (RD \ATITEMP).  

7. We recommend that you keep a copy of the ZIP files (64WIN155.ZIP and 
LOAD64.ZIP), in case you need to install the driver again.
