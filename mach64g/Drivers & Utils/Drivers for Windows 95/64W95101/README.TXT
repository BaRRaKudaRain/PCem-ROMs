5.0     Windows 95 mach64 enhanced display driver problems 
  
- The Windows 95 mach64 enhanced display driver is capable of using monitor 
   timing data contained within Windows 95. This data is selected by  
   configuring a monitor type at Windows 95 installation time or via the  
   "Settings" page of the display properties sheet. If you change the  
   selected monitor type via the "Settings" page of the display properties  
   sheet the new timing data may not take effect until after restarting  
   Windows 95. A solution to this problem is to always restart Windows 95  
   after changing the monitor type. 
 
 - The Windows 95 mach64 enhanced display driver is capable of using monitor 
   timing data contained within Windows 95. This data is selected by  
   configuring a monitor type at Windows 95 installation time or via the  
   "Settings" page of the display properties sheet. The Windows 95 mach64  
   enhanced display driver may incorrectly interpret Windows 95 monitor  
   timing data for some older monitors which require interlaced modes.  
   This may cause some options to be disabled. A solution to this problem  
   is to select one of the "(Standard monitor types)" available via the  
   settings page of the display properties sheet. 
 
 - In Windows 95, display drivers can be installed via the "Add New 
   Hardware" wizard. When the Windows 95 mach64 enhanced display driver 
   is installed via the "Add New Hardware" wizard the "Settings" page does 
   not get installed into the mach64 display adapter property sheet. A 
   solution to this problem is to use the driver installation procedure 
   described above.
